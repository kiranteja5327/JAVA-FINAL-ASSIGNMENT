 * 5. Demonstrate the difference between abstract class and interface by writing programs
      as well as in keypoints.
      
      
      
      
      Abstract class:                                              Interface:
* Abstract class having abstract                                    * In terrace having abstract methods
 Methods and non abstract methods

*Abstract class doesn’t support                                     * Interface support multiple inheritance
Multiple inheritance

* Abstract class having final &                                     * Interface having only final and static methods
 Non final and static and
Non-static variables

* Abstract can provide implementation of interface                  * Interface cannot  provide implementation of abstract class.

* It can done through using keyword                                 * It can don through interface keyword.
