/*
 * 
 * 9. Write a Java program that implements a producer-consumer model using
multithreading. The program should have a producer thread that generates random
numbers and adds them to a queue, and a consumer thread that reads numbers
from the queue and calculates their sum. The program should use synchronization to
ensure that the queue is accessed by only one thread at a time.
